# Mobile Improvements - Flexible view for Foundry VTT

Mobile Improvements changes the core UI to be flexible for use with mobiles,
tablets and other low-resolution devices.

# Installation

Mobile Improvements is available in the module browser. It can also be installed
manually with the following manifest URL:

```
https://gitlab.com/fvtt-modules-lab/mobile-improvements/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/module.json?job=build-module
```

## Unstable branch

If you want to live on the edge, you can use the latest version from the develop
branch, but there may be unfinished features and rough edges.
